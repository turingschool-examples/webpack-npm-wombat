# NPM and Webpack

What better way to learn about NPM and Webpack than with cute little wombats helping you along the way?!

This repo is associated with the [NPM & Webpack Lesson]() for Turing's BE4 class. During the lesson, students get practice initializing NPM, setting up Webpack, and should understand what NPM and Webpack do for us.

## Initial Setup

Clone down the repository, then open in browser with the following terminal commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/webpack-npm-wombat.git
open index.html
```

The application should open itself in your default browser.
